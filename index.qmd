# Preface {.unnumbered}

To learn more about Quarto books visit <https://quarto.org/docs/books>.

This is the landing/cover/overview page of the book.
It needs to be called `intro.qmd` and this name must not be changed.

The overall settings for the book such as style, theme, title, authors,
and overall interactive elements such as table of contents, search functions,
pagination, download function etc. are set in the `_quarto.yml` file. To see
an overview of setting options, check: <https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/books.html>

We can add new chapters to the the book by creating new files in the directory ending
with `.qmd`. For example, if we create a new file called `summary2.qmd`. We can write some text into it
and then add it to the book by listing it in the `_quarto.yml` file under `chapters:`

Within each chapter, we can structure headlines with `#` like so:

# Headline 1

## Headline 2

### Headline 3

#### Headline 4

##### Headline 5

###### Headline 6

## Markdown Basics

We can make text bold, italicized, strikethrough or use verbatim code highlights:

*italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics***

superscript^2^ / subscript~2~

~~strikethrough~~

`verbatim code`

display math: $$E = mc^{2}$$

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.

## Pay Attention

Using callouts is an effective way to highlight content that your reader give special consideration or attention.
